            <p>INDIA IN WORLD POPULATION<p>
            <p>The estimated global population in 2010 was 6908.7 croce. The population of 10 countries has all grown over the last decade, except in Russian Federation, which has declined.</p>
            <p>At present, these ten countries account for nearly three-fifths of the world population. The three most populous ones, namely, China, India, and the USA, together account for four of</p> 
            <p>every ten persons of the world.</p>
            <p>At present, a little more than one out of every six persons in the world is from India.</p>
            <br>
            <p>POPULATION GROWTH: INDIA 1901 TO 2011</p>
            <p>The population of India, at the turn of the twentieth century, was only around 238.4 million. This has increased by more than four times in a period of one hundred and ten years</p>
            <p>to reach 1210 croce in 2011.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, the population of India grew by one and half times in the first half of the twentieth century, while in the latter half it recorded a phenomenal three-fold increase as recorded in each </p>
            <p>decadal Census since 1901.</p> 
            <p>Some other indicators of growth rate such as decadal growth rate, change in decadal growth, average annual exponential growth rate, and progressive growth rate over 1901 during each decade</p>
            <p>have also been presented in this statement.</p> 
            <p>One of the important features of the years 2001-2011 is that the first decade (with the exception of 1911-1921) has added a lesser population compared to the previous decade.</p> 
            <p>This implies that as a result of the combination of population momentum</p> 
            <p>and somewhat impeded fertility, although India continues to grow in size, its pace of net addition is on the decrease.</p>
            <p>In absolute terms, the population of India has increased by about 181 croce during the decade 2001-2011. Although the net addition in population during each decade has increased consistently, </p>
            <p>the changes in net addition have shown a steady declining trend over the decades starting from 1961.</p> 
            <p>While 27.9 croce more people were added between the decade 1981-1991 than between 1971 1981, this number declined to 19.2 croce for the decades between 1981-1991 and 1991-2001. </p>
            <p>The provisional results of 2011 show that between 2001 and 2011, the net addition is less than that of the previous decade by 0.86 croce.</p>
